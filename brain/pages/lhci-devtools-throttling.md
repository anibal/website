<!-- compiled_truth -->
**Decided:** Lighthouse CI runs with `throttlingMethod: 'devtools'` (real network/CPU throttling, observed timings), mobile form factor, asserting the handoff gates on `/` and `/es/`: 100/100/100/100, LCP ≤ 1500ms, CLS = 0, TBT ≤ 50ms. **Not** the LHCI default `simulate` (Lantern model).

**Rationale:** measured floor under Lantern simulation on this design is LCP ≈ 1500–1650ms with **zero webfonts, zero JS, fully inlined CSS** (Lantern inflates a large display-size text element's paint task ~800ms past FCP under its 4× CPU model; every webfont adds ~750ms to the chain). The handoff gates are therefore physically unattainable under simulation and meaningful only under observed-throttled timing — which is also closer to field experience (observed LCP 848ms).

**Blast radius:** CI assertions live in `lighthouserc.cjs`; if gates are ever recalibrated (e.g. to CrUX field data), revisit. Enforces [[performance-as-design-feature]]; enables honest measurement of [[font-loading-strategy]].
